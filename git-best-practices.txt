Git is helpful for me in 2 ways! 
    i. It makes me a better collaborator
    ii. I can use it to keep track of all my personal project and commitments 

3 helpful practices are:- 
    i. to never edit files directly from GitHub
        a. Bring the files to the local computer.
        b. Change, stage, commit, push! 
    ii. using Atomic commits
    iii. Leveraging the Atomic commits of others to do any further enquiry 

Q. What is an Atomic commit?
Ans == changes relating to only one specific feature of the entire project
    Why?
    So as:- 
    i. to know which commit has created problems in your code + revert it easily
    ii. I will horn my commiting abilities
        Why?
        Cause a project is made up of many small small features
        And when I will be adding those, all I will do is to explain that single feature
        in detail! 

        It will also help me understand my own workflow well!
