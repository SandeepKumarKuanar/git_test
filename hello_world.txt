I initially started coding in Python, now I am learning Data Science and A.I. init 
to help my research abilities.
But now I am learning Web-Dev to earn some 'extra' knowledge and money!
Hence, this are my method for saying you hello :- 
print('Hello, World!')  <-- by python3.12
alert('Hello, World!'); console.log('Hello, World!') <-- by JavaScript ES14
